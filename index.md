## Learn Python Programming & Data Science Together

Berkeley's fastest growing course in history is Foundations of Data Science, an entry-level course that combines introductions to Python programming, statistics, and machine learning. Students who have never programmed before and students with substantial programming experience both take this course in order to understand how programming can be used as a tool for manipulating, visualizing, and understanding data. Now, three award-winning professors have teamed up to bring the course to everyone. You can [enroll for free today on EdX](https://www.edx.org/course/foundations-data-science-computational-uc-berkeleyx-data8-1x) to experience the same course that thousands of UC Berkeley students choose as their first course in statistics and computer science.
