## Learn Python Programming & Data Science Together

UC Berkeley's fastest growing course in history is *Foundations of Data Science*, which combines introductions to Python programming, statistics, and machine learning into one course that is designed for first-time programmers. At Berkeley, students who have never programmed before *and* students with substantial programming experience both take this course in order to learn how to manipulate, visualize, and analyze real-world data using state-of-the-art tools. 

Now, three award-winning professors have teamed up to offer Data 8X to everybody. You can [enroll for free today on EdX](enroll.html) to experience the same course that thousands of UC Berkeley students have chosen as their introduction to statistics and computer science.

Those who enroll in this free online course will:
- Learn Python 3 and core data science modules such as NumPy.
- Master statistics concepts such as confidence intervals and sample sizes.
- Understand how machine learning allows computers to make smart decisions.
- Learn to use Jupyter, perhaps the world's most popular data science environment.
- Gain free access to a Google-sponsored compute cloud with all software pre-installed.
