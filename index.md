## Learn Python Programming & Data Science Together

UC Berkeley's fastest growing course in history is Foundations of Data Science, which combines introductions to Python programming, statistics, and machine learning into one course that is designed to be inviting to first-time programmers and cover the most critical concepts in contemporary data science. At Berkeley, Students who have never programmed before and students with substantial programming experience both take this course in order to understand how programming can be used as a tool for manipulating, visualizing, and understanding data. 

Now, three award-winning professors have teamed up to offer Data 8X to everybody. You can [enroll for free today on EdX](enroll.html) to experience the same course that thousands of UC Berkeley students choose as their introduction to statistics and computer science.

Students in this free online course will:
- Learn to program using Python 3 and core data science modules such as NumPy and Matplotlib.
- Master fundamental statistics concepts such as confidence intervals and experiment design.
- Understand how machine learning allows computers to make smart decisions automatically from data.
- Use Jupyter, perhaps the world's most popular data science environment.
- Gain free access to a Google-sponsored course cloud that has all course software and assignments pre-installed.
